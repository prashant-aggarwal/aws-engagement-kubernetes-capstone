#### Deploy a 3-tier web-based application including the backend database:
- Deploy the application in a declarative way in an Amazon EKS cluster.
- The application should be able to scale automatically, use services as necessary, include a backend database, and the configuration should be repeatable.
- Either use your own or any third party application.
